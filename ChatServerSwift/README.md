# swift-server

An Server-Sent Events server in Swift, built on the Vapor framework.

## Running the server

The server expects the working dir to be the `swift-server` dir.

To set this in Xcode, choose `Product -> Scheme -> Edit Scheme` in the menu, navigate to the `Options` tab and set up the `Working Directory` option.
